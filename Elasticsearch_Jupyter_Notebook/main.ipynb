       " 'content': 'Scientists have found a near-complete skull and a jaw from a pair of giant rodents belonging to a group that lived millions of years ago in South America, and they say the fossils show that the extinct creatures weighed as much as 1 ton when fully grown.These are the best-preserved fossils to date of this extinct group, which was previously known only by skull fragments and individual teeth, the scientists reported in a new study.The new fossils of the two rodents — an adult and a juvenile — paint a more complete picture of the extinct and massive rat-like animals, the researchers said. For instance, the finds raise questions about how these giant rodents were classified within their genus, and hint that several species that were thought to be related may instead be a single species, the researchers wrote in the new study. [In Images: \\'Field Guide\\' Showcases Bizarre and Magnificent Prehistoric Mammals]A number of oversize rodent species roamed South America during the Miocene epoch, which lasted from about 23 million years ago to 5.3 million years ago, and some were downright gigantic. The largest rodent ever described, the enormous Josephoartigasia monesi, was roughly the size of a buffalo and had a bite force as powerful as a tiger\\'s, according to a study published in February 2016 in the Journal of Anatomy.However, most of these large-rodent lineages went extinct long ago, except for the capybara, a water-loving, web-footed rodent that can weigh as much as 174 lbs. (79 kilograms). Also known as \"water hogs\" and \"masters of the grasses,\" capybaras are found in Central and South America — with the exception of one rogue individual that recently appeared in central California. (After several sightings, this capybara still remains at large.)Fossils from the giant-rodent genus Isostylomys date back to the early 20th century, but the new finds from Uruguay\\'s Camacho Formation, a site from the late Miocene epoch — about 12 million to 5 million years ago — are the most complete to date.Scientists uncovered a nearly intact adult skull and jawbone, as well as a juvenile jawbone containing all of its teeth. Both individuals represent the species Isostylomys laurillardi, which is thought to be nearly as large as J. monesi. The fossils\\' exceptional condition allowed scientists to compare tooth development between the adult and the juvenile, thus providing a new perspective on all other species in this genus, which had been described from more fragmentary fossil evidence.The study authors found that the adult-tooth shape emerged fairly early in the rodent\\'s development, growing larger as the animal matured. Then, they evaluated prior fossil finds by considering three possible tooth forms for I. laurillardi — prenatal, juvenile and adult — recognizing that adult-tooth forms could vary in size. The researchers\\' analysis determined that three known Isostylomys species were, in fact, one species — I. laurillardi.\"Our study shows how the world\\'s largest fossil rodents grow,\" study lead author Andres Rinderknecht, a researcher in the Department of Paleontology at Uruguay\\'s National Museum of Natural History, said in a statement.The researchers concluded that, from a very young age, the giant rodents were very similar to the adults, Rinderknecht said. That conclusion led the research team to deduce that the vast majority of the prior hypotheses were wrong, he said.The findings were published online Tuesday (Feb. 21) in the Journal of Systematic Palaeontology.'}"

       "     'content': 'A bizarre-looking cat that roams the remote forests of the French island of Corsica may be a new species, according to local news reports.These felines are known to locals as \"cat-foxes,\" and wildlife rangers in Corsica think that they might be a new, undocumented species, according to the Agence France-Presse(AFP).These cat-foxes earned their name because of their size (slightly larger than an average domestic cat) and their tail decorations — most of them have two to four rings on their tails that end in a black tip. The cats are about 35 inches (90 centimeters) long from head to tail; they have wide ears, short whiskers and dog-like teeth, according to the AFP. [The 10 Strangest Animal Discoveries]Researchers at the National Hunting and Wildlife Office in Corsica have been examining these cats for over a decade. Back in 2012, they examined fur left behind when the cat-foxes rubbed their bodies on a stick that had been coated with an attractive scent. When the researchers examined the DNA from that fur,they found these cat-foxes weren\\'t related to any known species around the world, but their DNA was similar to that of the African forest cat (Felis silvestris lybica).Four years later, they captured the first cat-fox for examination and have since captured, examined and released 12 out of 16 individuals seen on the island. The researchers placed GPS collars on some of those cat-foxes, so they can follow the animals\\' meanderings on the island.The researchers found the feline\\'s main predator is the golden eagle; they hypothesize that the animal might have been brought to the remote island by farmers in 6500 B.C., according to the AFP. But there\\'s still much unknown about the cat-fox — and the researchers hope that the animal will be recognized as a new species and protected in the upcoming years.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'A big cat just got a CAT scan.Veterinary staff scanned the cat, a 14-year-old African lion named Tomo, to look at the extent of a fungal infection in the big guy\\'s gums, according to a statement from the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio.\"Tomo had an infection in his jaw,\" Dr. Randy Junge, a veterinarian and the vice president of animal health at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium, said in video posted to the zoo\\'s YouTube page on March 6. \"He had a tooth removed, and the area didn\\'t heal, so we were concerned that there might be something more involved in that area than just the bad tooth.\"CAT scans, or computerized axial tomography scans, combine a series of X-ray images taken from different angles to create \"slices\" of the body, according to the Mayo Clinic. The scans, which are also referred to as CT scans, provide doctors with more information than a traditional X-ray does. (\"This lion\\'s name is Tomo, and he got a tomo-graphy,\" Junge said.) [In Photos: A Lion\\'s Life]Indeed, without the scan, doctors would not have been able to look at the extent of Tomo\\'s infection, according to the statement.But performing a CAT scan on a big cat presents challenges.Junge noted that the CAT-scan table is made for humans, not other animals, and can hold only up to 500 lbs. (about 230 kilograms) — \"many of my zoo patients are going to go over that,\" he said in the video.Weighing in at 450 lbs. (204 kg), Tomo was \"pushing the limit. The machine groaned and grumbled a bit, but we were able to get the image done,\" Junge said.Another challenge was positioning Tomo correctly. \"For a human, they would say, lay this way, put your arms and legs here, hold still, hold your breath,\" Junge said. \"You obviously can\\'t do [those things] with a large animal, especially [one] under anesthesia.\"There was a lot of \"shifting and pushing and arranging and getting [Tomo] just right, but in the end, our images came out perfectly,\" and the veterinary staff was able to diagnose Tomo\\'s problem, Junge said.The vets confirmed that Tomo\\'s fungal infection hadn\\'t spread beyond the affected gum and said the problem will likely get better after the lion finishes a two-month course of antifungal medications.'}},\n",

Their eyes were saucer-like or almond-shaped, and their ears were tiny and perky, or swooping and bat-like, or folded close to their heads.While these feline champions didn\\'t resemble one another in the slightest, each winner was chosen as the best representative of its breed. But what are the features that define cat breeds, and what traits signify which individuals are championship material? [Photos:Champion Cats are Show-Stopping Stunners] The Cat Fanciers\\' Association (CFA) currently recognizes 42 cat breeds. These range from breeds that even casual cat lovers would recognize, such as Siamese, Persian and Maine coon, to the lesser-known LaPerm, Burmilla and ragamuffin. All cat breeds belong to the same species: Felis catus, or domestic cat. But generations of selective breeding produced combinations of traits that are specific to certain lineages of cats, which are then recognized as \"breeds\" by organizations such as the CFA.The CFA categorizes these traits to develop universal standards for distinguishing among breeds and for judging individual animals in competitions, said Teresa Keiger, a CFA all-breed judge.\"Every breed has a standard that describes the perfect example of that breed,\" Keiger told Live Science. \"It describes the breed in terms of body characteristics — body length, tail length, head shape and profile, coat color, texture and length — and then any other attribute that\\'s unique to the breed.\"For example, the sphynx, a hairless breed, is a lineage that originated from a kitten born in 1966 with a genetic mutation for hairlessness, the CFA said in a breed description. Though the breed gives the appearance of being bald, all of these cats have some hair on their nose and ears, and some have a downy coat that makes the cat feel like \"a warm peach\" to the touch, according to the CFA.CFA breed standards require that sphynx cats have eyes that are large, \"lemon-shaped\" and wide-set, with a minimum distance of one eye length between them. Ears must be \"large to very large,\" and the body should be well muscled, with back legs that are a bit longer than the front legs, according to the CFA.In competitions, CFA judges use a point system to compare how each cat measures up to the standard for that breed. For example, when judging the sphynx, they may award up to 35 points for traits relating to its head, up to 35 points for body traits, and up to 30 points for the quality of the cat\\'s coat and skin.And when judging between breeds for a \"best in show\" category, judges look to see which cat best represents its breed — an evaluation that partly hinges on the cat\\'s personality, Keiger said.\"Your best cat really exceeds breed standards — it has a little something extra,\" she said. \"It has presence, it has an aura, it says, \\'Look at me; I\\'m a champion.\\'\" [6 Secrets to Unlocking Your Cat\\'s Personality] These pampered cats can be traced back to as early as 10,000 years ago in what is now Turkey, where their domestication journal began, scientists recently discovered. For thousands of years, domesticated cats likely resembled their striped wildcat ancestors, but different markings in their fur began to emerge during the Middle Ages, around the 13th century. And the even greater variety in coat patterns that we see in cats today arose from selective breeding that began in the 19th century, the researchers reported.But the basic size and shape of domestic cats — even among different breeds — has remained more or less the same, certainly more so than in dog breeds, which display a much more dramatic spectrum of physical variations. This difference between modern breeds of cats and dogs can be traced to the relationships their ancestors forged with people, Keiger told Live Science.After dogs were domesticated, people bred them so that their bodies would be better suited to perform certain jobs, she said.\"Dachshunds were bred to be long and skinny, to go down badger holes. Mastiffs were bred to be big guardian dogs,\" Keiger said.As for cats, \"you can\\'t really train a cat to do anything,\" Keiger said. Unlike dogs, cats that lived alongside people typically had only one job: catching pests such as rats and mice. So there wasn\\'t really much incentive for people to breed cats selectively to fill a job-related niche, the way they bred domesticated dogs, she explained.But even among cat breeds, there are some extreme examples of artificial selection that demonstrate breeders\\' aesthetic preferences, such as the tailless Manx, the curly-haired Devon rex or the popular flat-faced Persian. Persian cats have been selectively bred to have a distinctly flattened face, simply because people like the way it looks, according to Keiger. The Persian flat-face profile has become even more exaggerated in recent decades — a trend that reflects the preferences of the animals\\' breeders, Keiger told Live Science.\"If you look at photos and drawings of Persian cats from 100 years ago, 50 years ago, even from 30 years ago, the heads have become shorter and shorter,\" she said. \"That\\'s been a look that\\'s become popular.\"\"As judges, we influence the way cats and breeds look — if we start rewarding a particular look, breeders will start breeding toward that look. I have to think about that as a responsibility, too,\" Keiger added.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'The deadliest cat on Earth isn\\'t a shaggy-maned lion, a sleek leopard or a stealthy tiger. It\\'s a wee cat that you\\'ve probably never heard of: Africa\\'s smallest feline, the black-footed cat.Native to the grasslands of southern Africa, the black-footed cat has an endearingly round face and a light brown, black-spotted body that is small even compared to domestic cats. The wild feline measures only 14 to 20 inches (36 to 52 centimeters) long, stands about 8 inches (20 cm) tall and weighs about 2 to 6 lbs. (1 to 3 kilograms), according to the International Society for Endangered Cats(black-footed cats are listed as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature).Admittedly, those measurements don\\'t sound very impressive when compared to the sizable big cats that are among the world\\'s most fearsome predators. But despite its small size, the black-footed cat hunts and brings down more prey in a single night than a leopard does in six months, according to the PBS Nature miniseries \"Super Cats.\" [Meet the Rare and Fabulous Felines of \\'Super Cats\\' (Photos)]The second episode in the miniseries aired on PBS last night (Oct. 31). It featured an unprecedented glimpse of the black-footed cat, along with views of other fascinating and elusive wild felines, such as a pregnant jaguarin Costa Rica, a rare swamp tiger in India and a family of fishing cats — the only semiaquatic cats — in the wetlands of Asia.For the latest episode, titled \"Cats in Every Corner,\" filmmakers captured never-before-seen views of black-footed cats by collaborating with researcher Alexander Sliwa, a curator at the Cologne Zoo in Germany who has studied the black-footed cat since the 1990s. Through Sliwa, the series\\' makers gained access to several small cats that had already been fitted with radio collarsat a study site in South Africa, \"Super Cats\" producer Gavin Boyland told Live Science.Filming the tiny cats proved unusually challenging, Boyland said. Because the black-footed cats are so small, they\\'re harder to track through tall grasses than big cats are. Since the little cats hunt mostly at night, the production crew needed to use a special light-sensitive camera to detect the felines at all, recording footage of hunting behavior that had never been captured before, Boyland explained.And when it comes to hunting, as the filmmakers saw, the black-footed cat is extraordinarily efficient — \"a real powerhouse,\" said Luke Hunter, Chief Conservation Officer at Panthera, a global wildcat-conservation organization.Hunter, who served as a scientific consultant for \"Super Cats,\" explained that small predatorslike the black-footed cat have accelerated metabolisms, which they need to keep fueled all the time, \"so they\\'re constantly hunting,\" he said.Black-footed cats use three very different techniques to nab their prey. One method is known as \"fast hunting,\" in which the cats bound quickly and \"almost randomly\" through the tall grass, flushing out small preysuch as birds or rodents, Hunter said. Another of their methods takes them on a slower course through their habitat, with the cats weaving quietly and carefully to sneak up on potential prey.Finally, they use a sit-and-wait approach near rodents\\' burrows, a technique called still hunting, Hunter said.\"They wait for up to 2 hours, [staying] absolutely immobile, just silently waiting at the burrow for a rodent to appear. And then they nab it,\" Hunter told Live Science.In one night, a black-footed cat kills between 10 and 14 rodents or small birds, averaging a kill about every 50 minutes, according to Hunter. With a 60 percent success rate, black-footed cats are about three times as successful as lions, which average a successful kill about 20 to 25 percent of the time, Hunter said.\"If you\\'re a gazelle or a wildebeest, a black-footed cat isn\\'t at all deadly. But those success rates make them the deadliest little cat on Earth,\" he said.Black-footed cats represent but one species in a highly diverse feline family, many of which are difficult to observe in the wild and are not well-understood. And though most of the felines that appear in \"Super Cats\" face serious threats of habitat loss and destruction from human activity, conservation efforts can yet preserve vulnerable populations, Hunter said.\"I believe it\\'s mostly not doom and gloom. But if we don\\'t actively conserve these species, if we don\\'t work to reduce those threats, then we could lose some of these animals,\" he added.Episode 2 of \"Super Cats\" is available to stream beginning today (Nov. 1). You can also watch Episode 1 — \"Extreme Lives\" — and learn more about the miniseries on the PBS Nature websiteand on PBS apps. Episode 3, \"Science and Secrets,\" premieres Wednesday, Nov. 7, at 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings).'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'If you see a house cat, the odds are high that it will have white paws, a look that many owners affectionately call \"socks.\" But socks are rarely seen in wildcats, the elusive and undomesticated cousin of the house cat, so why do so many pet cats sport furry white feet?As it turns out, this story started about 10,000 years ago, when humans and cats decided life was better together.This domestication eventually led to über-prevalent socks on cats, as well as other well-known coat patterns, said Leslie Lyons, professor emerita and head of the Feline Genetics Laboratory at the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine.Related: Why do cats wiggle their butts before they pounce?\"As humans became farmers and started staying in one place, they had grain stores and refuse piles\" that attracted rodents, Lyons said. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement: the humans had fewer rodents to deal with and the cats got an easy meal.The wild, undomesticated progenitor species of house cats, Felis silvestris, lives in Africa and Eurasia. One population of them even lives on Mount Etna, an active volcano in Sicily. These felines are tasty snacks as kittens and stealthy predators as adults, so individuals born with a coat that offers camouflage have tended to survive and reproduce.But not every F. silvestris is born with a coat that blends into its habitat.\"Genetic mutations are occurring all the time,\" Lyons said.There isn\\'t much evidence to indicate why early cat people chose the individuals they did, but Lyons said the range of coats seen on modern domestic cats shows that our agrarian ancestors favored cats with markings that would have interfered with their camouflage. In its native mixed forest or scrub desert environment, a cat with stark white paws would have stood out to predators and prey.When humans started taking an interest in cats, these white paws would have stood out to them, too. \"There were probably people saying, \\'I particularly like that kitten because it has white feet. Let\\'s make sure it survives,\\'\" Lyons said.Humans probably also selected for cats who were calm and comfortable around humans, Lyons said. Behavioral traits seem unrelated to coat color, but for reasons that scientists don\\'t fully understand, white spots tend to appear when the tamest individuals are selected and bred. It\\'s true of horses, pigs, mice, cows and rats.These distinctive fur colors and markings emerge while a cat embryo is developing. The cells that give cat fur its color first appear as neural crest cells, which are located along what will become the back, Lyons said.Then, those cells slowly migrate down and around the body. If those waves of cells move far enough to meet each other on the cat\\'s front side, the embryo will be born a solid-colored kitten, such as an all-black or all-orange cat. Felines develop white feet, faces, chests and bellies when these cells don\\'t quite make it all the way.So, the next time you see a kitty wearing white socks, you\\'ll know that this signature feature is a result of genetic mutations, domestication and developmental biology. Although if you try telling the cat that, it will probably just look at you quizzically before sauntering away.'}},\n",

So what makes our feline friends so chatty with us?The answer has to do with domestication, experts told Live Science.Related: Why dog breeds look so very different, but cats don\\'tBefore cats took up residence with humans almost 10,000 years ago, they were loners, wrote John Bradshaw and Charlotte Cameron-Beaumont in the book \"The Domestic Cat: The Biology of Its Behaviour\" (Cambridge University Press 2000). Because these ancestral cats rarely encountered other members of their own species, they didn’t need to use their voices to communicate. Instead, these wild cats communicated through their sense of smell, or by rubbing against or urinating on objects like trees. That way, cats didn\\'t have to come face-to-face with other feisty felines in order to send a message. That\\'s still largely the way cats communicate with one another, said John Wright, a psychologist studying animal behavior at Mercer University in Georgia.\"Why use vocalization when it\\'s so efficient to use the other senses?\" Wright told Live Science.But humans don\\'t have nearly as fine-turned a sense of smell as felines. (And we\\'re unlikely to appreciate a cat spraying urine all over a new sofa.) So, cats communicate with their humans in the way that is most likely to get them what they want: by meowing. \"They\\'re manipulative,\" Wright said. \"Vocal communication becomes a tool.\"Many cats even develop a repertoire of meows to express different needs and feelings or elicit different responses. For example, your cat might trill at you in greeting, squeak a friendly request to go outside or demand food with a loud meow.Meowing at humans is partially a learned behavior. All cats meow as kittens to get their mom\\'s attention when they\\'re hurt, cold or when she accidentally sits on them. While house cats carry this behavior into adulthood, feral cats (domesticated cats without owners that live outdoors) mostly outgrow it. One study, published in the journal Behavioral Processes, found that feral cats were much more likely to growl or hiss than domesticated cats who had owners. When feral cats did meow, it was indiscriminate — at humans, dolls and dogs alike. House cats meowed much more often, and only at humans, suggesting that they develop meowing as a language specifically for their owners. In other words, your cat meows at you because early on, she learned that doing so got your attention.—Why do cats stretch so much?—Why do cats wiggle their butts before they pounce?—Why do cats and dogs love a good head scratch?If you\\'re curious what your cat has to say, it\\'s possible to encourage communication, Wright said. If humans respond with words and attention to their cats\\' chirps and meows, they can create a back-and-forth — almost like a conversation. \"If you make your responses positive enough and predictive enough that she can listen to your vocalization, then she [the cat] can try and communicate with you,\" Wright said.'}},\n",

And it\\'s not all that surprising; other mammals also host microbes that can produce the volatile chemicals used in communication.Having shown this relationship between felines and their microbiome, the researchers can begin larger studies to better understand how microbes interact with their hosts.\"In this study, we looked at one cat at one time in a lot of detail,\" Coil said.\"What\\'s needed now is a much bigger study looking at all the questions this one raised.\"The Bengal cat in Oakland was unavailable for comment.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'Modern cat lovers can thank the farmers of ancient Anatolia in the Near East for domesticating their fluffy friends about 10,000 years ago, a new study finds.Cat domestication likely began when these furry wildcats began hunting rodents that were feasting on grains harvested by Neolithic farmers. The farmers welcomed the sly, four-pawed hunters, and eventually started relying on them to keep vermin at bay.This defining moment happened in what is now modern-day Turkey, and these friendly felines quickly spread across the Old World as cat lovers moved across to the Bosporus Strait to Europe, the researchers found. [See the Remains of Ancient Cats from the Ancient World]However, it wasn\\'t until the Middle Ages, after thousands of years of living alongside humans, that some cats (Felis silvestris) developed fur with patch-like patterns, and not until the 19th century that they were bred to have fancy coats, the researchers found.\"This suggests that for a very long time, cats have not been subject to strong selection through breeding, and that the present-day breeds, in particular the fancy breeds, are mostly a modern \\'invention\\' from the 19th century,\" said study co-senior researcher Eva-Maria Geigl, a research director at the French National Center for Scientific Research.Archaeologists once thought that the Egyptians domesticated cats about 4,000 years ago, but that changed in 2004 when researchers reported on a 9,500-year-old cat and human burial in Cyprus, Live Science previously reported. Moreover, in 2013, another study suggested that cat domestication began 5,300 years ago in China.The new study is the first to examine the DNA from a vast number of domesticated cats remains, ranging in age from 100 to 9,000 years ago, said Geigl, who is also head of a group at the Institute Jacques Monod, a biology research center in Paris.Study lead researcher Claudio Ottoni, a paleogeneticist Leuven University in Belgium, examines a cat mummy at the National History Museum in London. The researchers were unable to analyze the DNA of this particular mummy because wrapped mummies cannot be sampled. Rather, they got samples from deteriorated mummies. Credit: Copyright Wim van NeerIt\\'s nearly impossible to tell the difference between domesticated cats and the five known subspeciesof wildcat simply by looking at their skeletal remains. So, to get to the bottom of the cat domestication mystery, the researchers analyzed the DNA from the bones, teeth, skin and hair of more than 200 cats found at archaeological sites in the Near East, Africa and Europe.\"Our group had devised a new barcoding method that is very sensitive and efficient, and allowed us to analyze the many highly degraded samples,\" Geigl told Live Science in an email. (In barcoding methods, scientists use a short genetic stretch of DNA to identify specific species.)The results revealed at least one and possibly two lineages of cats led to modern kitties. One lineage — Felis silvestris lybica, a subspecies of wildcat found in the Near East, including Anatolia — spread with humans into what is now the European countries of Bulgaria as early as 4400 B.C. and Romania as early as 3200 B.C., the researchers found.\"The cat, being a territorial animal, does not move a lot on its own,\" Geigl said. \"The archaeological and historical records tell us that cats probably were translocated mostly through ships, since the spread was relatively fast.\"In contrast, the Egyptians domesticated a lineage of African cats, including some they mummified. This Egyptian lineage spread across the Mediterranean along trade routes during the first millennium B.C., likely as sailors took cats aboard to hunt vermin, the researchers found.Once these boats docked, these Egyptian felines pitter-pattered off, and mated with local cats, both tame and wild, giving rise to hybrid kitties. For instance, Egyptian cat remains were found at the Viking trading port of Ralswiek on the Baltic Sea in the seventh century A.D., Geigl said. [Images: Ancient Egyptian Kittens]\"It\\'s still unclear, however, whether the Egyptian domestic cat descends from cats imported from the Near East or whether a separate, second domestication took place in Egypt,\" study lead researcher Claudio Ottoni, a paleogeneticist Leuven University in Belgium, said in a statement. \"Further research will have to show.\"Most ancient cats had stripes like their wild ancestors, according to DNA analyses of a single point mutation (the changing of one DNA \"letter\") in their genes, the researchers found. Likewise, Egyptian murals also depict striped cats, the researchers said.\"Interestingly, the Egyptian iconography depicts an evolution of the relationship between cats and humansfrom the thirdto the second half of the secondmillennium B.C.,\" Geigl said. \"The cats in the representations start off as a wild, fierce animal killing the snake that threatened the sun god Ra; later it is depicted as an animal that hunts birds in the marshes together with men, and then it is depicted under the chair of noble people.\"But in the Middle Ages, cats with \"blotched,\" or patched coat patterns, became more prevalent, the researchers found.\"[We] saw that the point mutation indicative of the blotched pattern arose only after the 13thcenturyin the Middle East, and became frequent in the following centuries,\" Geigl said. \"This means that the cat became a companion of humans without changing much. For a long time, it was a very useful animal that eliminated pests and venomous animals and did that naturally, nobody had to tell them or had to breed them in order to achieve this result. It became a pet probably much later.\"The study was published online today (June 19) in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.'}}]}}"

      "Author: Grant Currin || Date: 2020-02-29\n",
      "\n",
      "\t If you see a house cat, the odds are high that it will have white paws, a look that many owners affectionately call \"socks.\" But socks are rarely seen in wildcats, the elusive and undomesticated cousin of the house cat, so why do so many pet cats sport furry white feet?As it turns out, this story started about 10,000 years ago, when humans and cats decided life was better together.This domestication eventually led to über-prevalent socks on cats, as well as other well-known coat patterns, said Leslie Lyons, professor emerita and head of the Feline Genetics Laboratory at the University of Missouri College of Veterinary Medicine.Related: Why do cats wiggle their butts before they pounce?\"As humans became farmers and started staying in one place, they had grain stores and refuse piles\" that attracted rodents, Lyons said. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement: the humans had fewer rodents to deal with and the cats got an easy meal.The wild, undomesticated progenitor species of house cats, Felis silvestris, lives in Africa and Eurasia. One population of them even lives on Mount Etna, an active volcano in Sicily. These felines are tasty snacks as kittens and stealthy predators as adults, so individuals born with a coat that offers camouflage have tended to survive and reproduce.But not every F. silvestris is born with a coat that blends into its habitat.\"Genetic mutations are occurring all the time,\" Lyons said.There isn't much evidence to indicate why early cat people chose the individuals they did, but Lyons said the range of coats seen on modern domestic cats shows that our agrarian ancestors favored cats with markings that would have interfered with their camouflage. In its native mixed forest or scrub desert environment, a cat with stark white paws would have stood out to predators and prey.When humans started taking an interest in cats, these white paws would have stood out to them, too. \"There were probably people saying, 'I particularly like that kitten because it has white feet. Let's make sure it survives,'\" Lyons said.Humans probably also selected for cats who were calm and comfortable around humans, Lyons said. Behavioral traits seem unrelated to coat color, but for reasons that scientists don't fully understand, white spots tend to appear when the tamest individuals are selected and bred. It's true of horses, pigs, mice, cows and rats.These distinctive fur colors and markings emerge while a cat embryo is developing. The cells that give cat fur its color first appear as neural crest cells, which are located along what will become the back, Lyons said.Then, those cells slowly migrate down and around the body. If those waves of cells move far enough to meet each other on the cat's front side, the embryo will be born a solid-colored kitten, such as an all-black or all-orange cat. Felines develop white feet, faces, chests and bellies when these cells don't quite make it all the way.So, the next time you see a kitty wearing white socks, you'll know that this signature feature is a result of genetic mutations, domestication and developmental biology. Although if you try telling the cat that, it will probably just look at you quizzically before sauntering away.\n",

      "\t A domestic cat in Belgium has been infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that's spreading across the globe, the government's FPS Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment announced March 27, according to news reports.ÂThis is the first human-to-cat transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). About a week after its owner got sick with COVID-19, after returning from a trip to Northern Italy, the cat developed coronavirus symptoms: diarrhea, vomiting and respiratory issues, Steven Van Gucht, virologist and federal spokesperson for the coronavirus epidemic in Belgium, told Live Science.The owner sent samples of vomit and feces to Dr. Daniel Desmecht's lab at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine of Liège. Genetic tests showed high levels of SARS-CoV-2 in those samples, he said. \"The cat recovered after 9 days,\" Van Gucht said.Related: 13 Coronavirus myths busted by scienceCats and humans appear to have a similar \"doorknob\" on the surfaces of respiratory cells that lets the SARS-CoV-2 virus get inside, according to Van Gucht.ÂIn humans, scientists have figured out that the SARS-CoV-2 virus attaches to a receptor protein called ACE2 that's on the outside of respiratory cells. Once inside of these cells, the virus hijacks certain machinery so it can replicate.Â\"The feline ACE2 protein resembles the human ACE2 homologue, which is most likely the cellular receptor which is being used by Sars-CoV-2 for cell entry,\" Van Gucht said.During the 2003 SARS outbreak, cats were infected with a coronavirus as well, Van Gucht said.ÂThe only other pets thought to have \"caught\" the novel coronavirus from owners were two dogs in Hong Kong. The first dog, a 17-year-old Pomeranian, tested a weak positive for the virus at the end of February, Live Science reported. The dog died in mid-March, though the exact cause of death is not known, as the owner didn't allow an autopsy.ÂA second dog, a German shepherd, tested positive but showed no symptoms of the disease, Bloomberg reported.During the outbreak of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), dogs and cats contracted low levels of that virus, animal health expert Vanessa Barrs from City University told the South China Morning Post.There have been no reports of pets passing the virus to their human owners, and Van Gucht stressed that even human-to-pet transmission is not a significant path of viral spread.Â\"We think the cat is a side victim of the ongoing epidemic in humans and does not play a significant role in the propagation of the virus,\" he said.ÂTo prove definitively that the cat was infected with SARS-CoV-2, scientists will need a blood test to look for antibodies specific to this virus, Van Gucht said. Those tests will happen once the cat is no longer under quarantine.Originally published on Live Science.ÂABCmouse - 1 Month Free!\n",

      "Headline: Fisher cats: Animals that aren't cats, nor are they really fishers\n",
      "Author: Rachel Kaufman || Date: 2020-11-04\n",
      "\n",
      "\t If the fisher cat isn't the most inaccurately named animal in North America, it's certainly up there. This weasel relative is not a cat, and it doesn't care much for fishing. But that doesn't mean it's not an interesting creature in its own right.Also called fishers (Pekania pennanti), these small mammals live in forests in Canada and across the United States. They are roughly cat-size and have long, thin bodies, covered in a fur coat that was so highly valued in the fur trade a century ago that fishers were hunted to extinction in some parts of their home range, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. But because fur has somewhat fallen out of style, and thanks to successful reintroduction, habitat restoration and conservation efforts, fishers are making a comeback in many places, the Post-Gazette reported.Related: The most endangered species on the planetFishers are still trapped for their fur, and legal harvest, monitored by wildlife biologists, is one of the ways researchers know that fisher populations are growing in most parts of their historic habitat. Another reason researchers know fishers are on the rebound is because people are seeing the creatures more frequently, as the fearless animals explore their range. A fisher was even spotted in the Bronx, New York in 2014.The animal's name is usually the first thing people ask about, said Michael Joyce, a wildlife ecologist at the Natural Resources Research Institute of the University of Minnesota Duluth. \"Fisher\" is likely a corruption of the French word \"fiche,\" (originally a Dutch word) which refers to the European polecat (Mustela putorius), a small species of weasel found in Europe and Morocco. It's possible that early European settlers misidentified the fishers of North America as polecats.Although \"fisher cat\" is a bit of a misnomer, it's not because the animals won't eat fish, Joyce said, but because they eat a lot of things and fish isn't usually at the top of the list. In New England, for example, biologists have found that fisher cats seem to enjoy dining on gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) most often, Northern Woodlands magazine reported. The animals also eat fruit, reptiles and amphibians, birds and bird eggs, other small mammals, and even each other, according to a 2017 study published in the journal BioOne Complete.The study's authors examined the stomach contents of 91 fishers, whose carcasses they had found in Pennsylvania. Of these fishers, 12 had bits of other fishers in their digestive tracts. The team speculated that the Pennsylvania population of fishers had grown so large so quickly that the animals were competing with each other for food and had grown aggressive toward one another.Related: Live Science talks 'Cannibalism' with author Bill SchuttBut the fisher's true dietary claim-to-fame is that it's one of the few animals that regularly attack and eat porcupines. Fishers \"run circles around [porcupines] to try to exhaust them,\" Joyce said. As the porcupine tires out, the fisher will snap at the quilled animal's face. Enough bites to the face, and the porcupine will eventually bleed out and die. Once the prey has died, the fisher will grasp the porcupine's face in its jaws and twist the prickly creature upside down to expose the belly, so the fisher can safely eat without getting quilled. However, fishers are sloppy eaters and will occasionally swallow a quill or two, Joyce said. But the quills don't seem to bother the fishers much.Fishers also don't seem to care if they get a quill to the face. While fishers don't have superpowers making them immune from quilling, they seem to be able to fend off infections from quill injuries that would kill other animals, Montana Public Radio reported. In an unpublished study of 100 fisher skulls collected by hunters, Joyce found that about one in 10 skulls had quills embedded in them, suggesting the tough little creatures had survived at least one unfortunate quilling.In addition to fearlessly hunting porcupines, fishers can also take down lynx — predatory cats that are about twice the size of an average fisher. Researchers tracking lynx with radio collars occasionally found their subjects dead in a snowdrift, with little fisher-size bite marks along their necks and heads, National Geographic reported.\"A fisher really doesn't have any boundaries in the size of the animal it's willing to attack,\" Scott McLellan, a wildlife biologist with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, told National Geographic.The fisher cat's reputation as an aggressive hunter has led to unfair and unfounded rumors that fisher cats attack and eat pets and even small children.\"I'm not aware of any, and I don't think there are any cases of fishers attacking humans,\" Joyce said, adding that while a fisher cat probably wouldn't think twice about eating a house cat if the opportunity presented itself, studies of fisher diets in human-dominated landscapes suggest your cat is probably safe. (Cats have more to fear from coyotes, owls and cars.) The rumors are likely fueled by the fact that the fisher's range is expanding, so people who have never seen the elusive animals before are now seeing fishers in their yards (and in some cases, trash cans).Another unusual characteristic of fisher cats is their piercing screams. Internet forums say a fisher's blood curdling screams, let out in the dead of night, signal that the creature is about to attack. But those noises are probably misidentified foxes, Roland Kays, curator of mammals at the New York State Museum, wrote in the New York Times. Foxes are generally very vocal, and therefore easy to record, while fishers are typically silent in order to better hunt their prey.\"They do make vocalizations,\" Kays wrote, but not the eerie screeches attributed to them. Instead, the fisher's vocalizations sound more like an \"agitated chuckle,\" Joyce said, similar to the sound a pet ferret makes, he added.While fishers have been reintroduced into much of their original range, there are still many areas where fisher populations have never recovered. In Minnesota, the fisher population has declined by an estimated 50% over the past 20 years, Joyce said. He believes that a lack of old trees is largely to blame: The fisher prefers to give birth and raise its young inside cavities in trees, but it takes decades for a tree to get big enough to have a cavity that will fit a fisher. \"One of our concerns is that large trees with cavities\" aren't abundant in areas where fishers live, he said.In an effort to provide more housing options for fishers, Joyce and his colleagues installed 100 den boxes in sites throughout northern Minnesota in the fall of 2019, and a year later, fishers had discovered and started to use 17 of them. If fishers start to use the den boxes more heavily, wildlife managers won't have to wait decades for large trees to grow before trying to help fisher populations, Joyce said.Another emerging threat to fisher populations is rat poison. A 2012 study published in the journal PLOS One found that four in five dead fishers picked up in California had rat poison in their bodies. The authors suspected that the rat poison was likely put out by illegal marijuana growers whose farms are hidden in public lands. (Even though the study was published prior to California's legalization of recreational cannabis use in 2016, there are still large illegal grow sites in the state.)Because fishers need healthy old-growth trees to survive, a healthy fisher population is an indicator that the forest is doing well as a whole. \"And they're one of our iconic species of the Northwoods,\" Joyce added. \"The chance you might see one on a hike is an added benefit.\"\n",

      "Headline: Can a cat parasite control your mind?\n",
      "Author: Benjamin Plackett || Date: 2020-10-03\n",
      "\n",
      "\t There's a single-celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii, and it can turn a normally risk-averse mouse into a bold, cat-seeking rodent. Cats that devour such mice can then pass the parasite onto humans.But once humans are infected, what happens to them? Do they become Toxoplasma gondii zombies, acting however the parasite deems fit?The answer is complex; studies show that people who test positive for this condition are more likely to take certain kinds of risks than those who don't have toxoplasmosis, but it's not yet clear how this happens.Related: Why do cats hate car rides?Toxoplasma gondii can live in most mammals, but its life cycle traditionally involves living first inside a mouse or rat. That's likely because cats prey on rodents, giving the parasite a way to reach the cat gut — the only known place where the parasite can reproduce, as cat guts are rich in linoleic acid, an ingredient necessary for Toxoplasma gondii sex, a 2019 study posted on the preprint database bioRxiv found.To aid this transition from vermin to feline host, Toxoplasma gondii has a pretty disturbing technique: brain manipulation. The parasite alters the behavior of rodents, making them less afraid of taking risks. It is also known to make mice attracted to the scent of cat poop. In other words, the parasite does something to the brain of mice and rats to make them more likely to dart out in front of a cat to then be caught, killed and eaten. Humans are not immune to Toxoplasma gondii — in fact, at least a third of the world's population is thought to have toxoplasmosis, the infection this parasite causes. Some humans get infected when they clean out their pet cat's litter box, but many of us simply eat undercooked meats or unwashed vegetables. So, what does this mean for the one in three of us who end up playing host to the parasite?\"When you first get infected, you might have mild flu-like symptoms but most of us don't even realize. If you're a pregnant women then it's more concerning because it can harm the child, but largely, infected people show almost no health issues or noticeable symptoms,\" said Markus Fitza, a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management in Germany, whose research has focused on how the parasite can affect decisions made in the business world.But that's not where the story ends. \"The fundamentals of the human brain are fairly similar to that of a mouse in the grand scheme of things,\" he told Live Science.In short, just like an infected mouse is more adventurous, an infected human is also more prone to take risks — sometimes with pretty devastating consequences. At least two studies — one analyzing 370 people in Turkey and another looking at nearly 600 people in the Czech Republic — have shown that people who test positive for Toxoplasma gondii antibodies are more likely to have a car crash. There isn’t a lot of evidence to explain why and how latent infections of toxoplasmosis might affect people’s personalities, such as making them less afraid of risk. The researchers behind the car crash studies, however, wrote that the parasite leaves behind life-long cysts in the brain, which is thought to increase the production of dopamine (a chemical messenger in the brain that is known to affect people's risk and reward calculations), and that may have a role to play. Related: Why do our brains have folds?Toxoplasmosis is also linked to rage problems. People with the psychiatric disorder known as Intermittent Explosive Disorder, or IED, were twice as likely to have a toxoplasmosis diagnosis than healthy individuals with no psychiatric diagnosis, Live Science previously reported.Interestingly though, a decreased fear of peril may also have its advantages. Fitza's own work has shown that entrepreneurs are more likely to be infected than the general population and that entrepreneurs with the parasite tend to earn, on average, $6,000 more per year than those without it. In one study, he and colleagues tested nearly 1,500 biology and business studies students at a major U.S. university. The results showed that business majors were 1.4 times more likely to test positive for the parasite than biology majors, and within business majors, those specializing in entrepreneurship were 1.7 times more likely to test positive over students in less risky business studies subspecialties.Fitza also tested 197 professionals attending entrepreneurship workshops and events. He found that 124 of them had been infected by the parasite. Of those 124 professionals, 17 had started their own business compared with just four out of the 73 non-infected people who attended the same events. While his sample size was small, the findings have been backed up by subsequent, larger studies. The working theory is that Toxoplasma gondii is manipulating people's brains into making them less afraid of quitting their jobs and going it alone to start up their own company. \"We can't say for sure this is what's happening,\" said Fitza. \"But this is the argument we're making based on our studies.\"—Why do cats bury their poop?—Where does all our poop go?—Why do mice poop so much?However, scientists have yet to pin down a direct way that Toxoplasma gondii might control human minds, Live Science previously reported. In rodents, it's possible that the parasite secretes molecules that somehow rewire the brain; others think it may be due to brain cysts interfering with dopamine production; and another idea is that Toxoplasma gondii triggers inflammation in rodent brains, which may, in turn, change brain behavior and function, a 2019 study in the journal mBio found.That said, humans with toxoplasmosis aren't mindless zombies doing the parasite's bidding. When in humans, there is no benefit to the parasite in making human behavior more risky; any effects are just a hangover from it manipulating the mouse brain, which is advantageous to the parasite. But given that the parasite might lead to some behavioral changes in humans, be mindful of that if you have cats and you're driving your car to a potential business opportunity.\n",

      "\n",
      "\t Two experimental drugs for cats could potentially help treat humans infected with COVID-19, Science News reported.A type of coronavirus that only infects cats can cause \"feline enteric coronavirus\" (FeCV), an infection that affects the gastrointestinal tract and seldom causes any symptoms, according to the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. However, in about one in 10 infected cats, the virus mutates after infecting the animal in a way that lets it infiltrate specific immune cells, spread throughout the body and set off severe inflammation. At this stage, the infection is called \"feline infectious peritonitis virus\" (FIPV) and is usually fatal if left untreated.Two experimental drugs have been designed to treat cats with FIPV, although neither has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which vets both animal and human drugs before they enter the market, according to Science News. That said, preliminary research hints that both drugs could be used to take down human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.Related: Treatments for COVID-19: Drugs being tested against the coronavirus\"The fact that this drug has already been developed and shown to be successful in treating feline infectious peritonitis, it really bodes well,\" biochemist Joanne Lemieux told Science News about one of the drugs, called GC376. The second drug, called GS-441524, has also been found to be \"highly effective in curing cats with feline infectious peritonitis, and usually without any other form of treatment,” Niels Pedersen, a veterinarian who studies the feline coronavirus at the University of California, Davis, told Science News.The two drugs work by preventing the feline coronavirus from replicating in cat cells; it may also disrupt how SARS-CoV-2 replicates in human cells.GC376, for example, hobbles a key enzyme called M protease that the feline coronavirus relies on to help make copies of its genetic material, known as RNA. While replicating, the virus builds long strands of proteins that M protease then chops up, to separate each individual protein from the next in the chain. The individual proteins then come together to build a new copy of the coronavirus. And so if M protease is damaged, the feline coronavirus cannot replicate and continue to make cats sick.Other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, also use M protease to build copies of the virus. A 2016 study, published in the journal PLOS Pathogens, revealed that GC376 also stops M protease from working in SAR-CoV and MERS-CoV, two coronaviruses that caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in humans in the 2000s. This year, a study in the journal Cell Research suggested that the drug can also stop SARS-CoV-2 from replicating in a test tube, while another study showed similar results in lab-grown monkey cells, according to Science News.Based on these results, Anivive Lifesciences, the company that manufactures GC376, plans to test the drug in human trials for use as a COVID-19 treatment.Related: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in historyThe second experimental cat drug, GS-441524, has shown similar success in animal studies of SARS-CoV-2, Science News reported. The drug works similarly to remdesivir, the antiviral shown to reduce recovery time in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. \"Partly because of feline infectious peritonitis research, a lot of veterinarians seemed to realize early in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic that remdesivir could be a promising candidate\" for COVID-19 treatment in humans, Susan Amirian, a molecular epidemiologist at Rice University in Houston, told Science News.Both drugs share a similar chemical structure that resembles a segment of viral RNA — molecules known as nucleotides that link up to form both RNA and DNA. When exposed to either drug, coronavirus enzymes wedge the molecule into the viral RNA in place of a true nucleotide, which brings viral replication to a standstill. Note that the drugs only work with RNA-virus enzymes, rather than human enzymes, so they don't mess up human DNA replication, according to the Scope Blog, published by Stanford Medicine.A study published in the journal Cell Reports showed that, in addition to stopping feline coronavirus, GS-441524 can also keep SARS-CoV-2 from replicating in lab-grown monkey and human cells. However, GS-441524 was most effective in the monkey cells, while remdesivir worked better than GS-441524 in human lung cells, according to Science News.—11 (sometimes) deadly diseases that hopped across species—14 Coronavirus myths busted by science—The 12 deadliest viruses on EarthThe biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences designed both remdesivir and GS-441524 and has begun early studies to compare the effects of both drugs against SARS-CoV-2, company spokesperson Chris Ridley told Science News.Previously, the company stated that it chose to focus on remdesivir over GS-441524 at the start of the pandemic because remdesivir had already been tested in human safety trials as an antiviral treatment for Ebola, which the drug didn't treat effectively, according to Science News. While testing remdesivir for Ebola, Gilead decided not to seek approval for GS-441524 use in animals because the drug so closely resembled remdesivir and may have somehow influenced the FDA-approval process, according to The Atlantic. Even now, GS-441524 has not been approved for use in cats and is usually bought as an expensive, black-market formulation, The Atlantic reported.At this point, neither GS-441524 nor GC376 have been tested in humans at all.\n",

       "     'content': 'In a world of bland hexagonal honeycombs, a small group of rebellious Australian bees has chosen to build spiral staircases.Meet the bees of the genus Tetragonula. These Aussie pollinators have no stingers, but make up for their defensive deficiencies by building mesmerizing fortresses of wax whose beauty has long captivated the Internet.These spiral structures are actually giant, swirly nests called \"brood combs.\" Each little circular cell is an egg chamber, built by a wax-secreting worker bee, provisioned with regurgitated food by a nurse bee, then filled with an egg by the queen herself. When one cell is done, workers move on to the next one, building outward and upward in a spiral pattern that can sometimes reach 20 stories tall, Tim Heard, an entomologist with The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) in Australia, previously told Live Science.Related: Googly eyes: See photos of striking wasp facesSo, how did the Tetragonula bees become the Frank Lloyd Wrights of the insect world? Does each colony employ its own master architect, charged with guiding his comb\\'s construction — or does each worker bee merely follow an unconscious set of individually-encoded building rules? According to a study published today (July 22) in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface, the answer could lie in crystals.\"These combs follow the same basic rules that cause crystals to grow up in a spiral pattern,\" study co-author Julyan Cartwright, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) who studies mathematical patterns in nature, told Live Science. \"Each bee is basically following an algorithm.\"Cartwright saw a viral image of the infamous brood combs a few years ago and immediately recognized the pattern; at the time, he was studying mother-of-pearl mollusks, whose iridescent shells also reveal distinct spiral structures when seen under an electron microscope.Both cases of animal architecture recalled research from the 1950s that explained how crystals naturally grow in a spiral structure by following a few simple, mathematical rules, Cartwright said. He and his colleagues wanted to find out what those rules might be for the Tetragonula bees.\"What sort of minimal information would a bee have that would lead it to produce these patterns?\" Cartwright said.To investigate, the researchers modeled the construction of a spiral comb using an algorithm inspired by crystal growth. Each simulation started with a single brood cell. One by one, digital worker bees added new cells to the comb by following one of two simple rules: Bees could add a cell to the growth front — the edge of the comb where other bees had been laying cells — so long as their new cell was placed slightly higher than its neighbors; or, bees could build a new cell on top of an existing cell, so long as that cell was more or less level with its neighboring cells.With these restrictions in place, each new level of the comb had to be built a good distance away from the edge, giving each new level a smaller radius than the last. The higher a level, the smaller its radius. And so, with just these few simple rules, the spiral pattern emerged.According to Cartwright, the ease with which his computer was able to recreate Tetragonula\\'s spiral combs shows that the bees aren\\'t following a master plan — rather, they are merely responding to their local environment according to a few biological rules coded into their behavior long ago.On the hunt: Honeybee scouts find food\\nCreative creatures: 10 animals that use tools\\n7 insects you\\'ll be eating in the future\"When humans build a structure like a building, we have an architect who makes a plan and then the builders follow it,\" Cartwright said. \"What we found is that the bees don\\'t need a plan. They just come with a set of simple rules as to where one should put a new piece of wax when it arrives at the comb. And if you program those rules into a computer, they produce the same pictures.\"What are those rules, exactly? Until we can ask the bees personally, there\\'s probably no way we can know for sure, the researchers wrote. Good thing they\\'re stingless.'}},\n",

But these new observations of the Cuban boas\\' pack-hunting offer evidence that some snakes hunt in groups. Of the 3,650 snake species known in the world, only a few have been observed hunting in the wild, according to the scientists.And coordination among snakes to catch prey has never been proved, said study author Vladimir Dinets, a professor of psychology at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, who specializes in animal behavior. [Shhh: A Gallery of Secretive Ground Snakes]\"It is possible that coordinated hunting is not uncommon among snakes, but it will take a lot of very patient field research to find out,\" Dinets said in a statement.The Cuban boa is the largest native terrestrial predator in Cuba. Cuba is also home to bat-filled caves, where small groups of boas will regularly hunt bats as they fly in and out of the cave, according to Dinets. He studied the snakes\\' hunting style, which included hanging down from the cave ceiling to grab bats as they flew through the entrance.When more than one boa was hunting, Dinets observed the snakes coordinating their positions to more effectively nab their prey.\"Snakes arriving to the hunting area were significantly more likely to position themselves in the part of the passage where other snakes were already present, forming a \\'fence\\' across the passage and thus more effectively blocking the flight path of the prey, significantly increasing hunting efficiency,\" Dinets wrote in the study.When a lone boa would strike, it sometimes failed to catch a bat. The group hunts, however, were always successful, Dinets said.The study\\'s findings were published online Feb. 2 in the journalAnimal Behavior and Cognition.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'Want to teach an old dog new tricks? Try letting your pet take a nap. New research finds that dogs consolidate new memories in sleep, just like humans do.The study used electroencephalography (EEG), a technique that measures electrical activity in the brain via the scalp, to track snoozing dogs\\' brain activity. Similar to humans, the dogs showed short bursts of activity, called sleep spindles, during non-rapid-eye-movement sleep. Also as in humans, the frequency of these sleep spindles was linked to how well a dog retained new information it had learned before its nap.\"It\\'s the first time that we can actually show this in a dog,\" said study co-author Ivaylo Iotchev, a doctoral student at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest, Hungary. [20 Weird Dog and Cat Behaviors Explained by Science]Most in-depth sleep research, Iotchev said, has focused on humans and rodents, specifically mice and rats. Seeing the parallels between dog sleep and human sleep is interesting, he told Live Science, because dogs are actually more distantly related to humans than mice are, evolutionarily speaking.Sleep spindles are also an interesting area of research because they\\'re related to learning and memory, Iotchev said. Sleep spindles are bursts of electrical activity in the brain that last about half a second, with a frequency of about 12 to 14 hertz in humans. These bursts block information from the thalamus, a chunk of gray matter in the forebrain that acts to relay sensory information, from reaching the cortex for more sophisticated processing.\"When sleep spindles happen, the brain is being shielded from outside information,\" Iotchev said, \"which is very important for memory consolidation, because when you want to remember something, you don\\'t want it to mix with outside information.\" [5 Interesting Facts About Sleep]Not much is known about this process in dogs, even though dogs are sometimes used as medical models for human brain disease, especially epilepsy. Until now, Iotchev said, dog EEG research focused mostly on whole-brain activity, like the transition from sleep to wakefulness. But sleep spindles specifically change with age, so understanding them can both help to improve veterinary medicine in elderly dogs and possibly reveal how similar the process of aging in dog brains is to that in human brains, Iotchev said.To examine sleep spindles in dogs, the researchers asked 15 dog owners to bring their pooches in for three separate sessions. The dogs represented a variety of breeds, ranging from mutt, to Labrador retriever, to miniature schnauzer. All of the dogs first took a snooze while researchers recorded the canines\\' baseline brain activity with EEG. Next, the dogs were randomly assigned to practice commands they already knew in Hungarian or to learn those same actions but with unfamiliar English words (\"sit\" and \"lie down\"). Seven of the dogs did the practice task in Hungarian first and then the new training in English. The eight completed the activities in the opposite order. [Like Dog, Like Owner: What Breeds Say About Personality]After each session, whether in Hungarian or English, the dogs got the chance to zonk out while the researchers recorded their brain activity. Linking the pattern of brain waves to actual learning was a key part of the study, Iotchev said, so after the nap, the dogs learning English commands did another session to show how well they\\'d retained the training.Sleep spindles, the researchers found, look much the same in dogs as they do in humans. They\\'re twice as frequent in female dogs as in male dogs, which matches the pattern seen in humans: Women have more sleep spindles than men thanks to the influence of sex hormones, Iotchev said.Dogs with more frequent sleep spindles during a snooze session also proved to be better learners than dogs with less frequent sleep spindles, the researchers found. Again, this result tracks with findings in humans and rodents. People with depression have more frequent sleep spindles than average, Iotchev said, and people with schizophrenia have less. Thus, these activity bursts may provide a window into the similarities in brain dysfunction between dogs and humans. For example, some researchers use dogs to try to understand attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Iotchev said. If humans with ADHD have atypical sleep spindles (and some research indicates they may), researchers would want to look to see if dogs show the same sort of aberrations. If they do, it would indicate that some of the same brain processes underlie ADHD in both humans and dogs. If they don\\'t, dogs might not be the best models for that disorder. Iotchev and his team are especially focused on relating their findings to aging.\"The next step is, we will look at a huge sample of dogs to see how sleep spindles change with age,\" he said.The researchers published their findings Oct. 11 in the open-access journal Scientific Reports.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'Associate Editor\\n23 July 2020\\nThe jury\\'s still out until another specimen of the species gets analyzed. A fossil attributed to a teensy, feathered dinosaur may not be a dinosaur at all, but rather a ... lizard, according to new research. With the new criticism, the March study — titled \"Hummingbird-sized dinosaur from the Cretaceous period of Myanmar\" was retracted yesterday (July 22) from the journal Nature where it had been published, according to a statement in the journal.The creature’s 99 million-year-old skull was entombed in amber when scientists discovered it in a mine in Myanmar (formerly Burma), and while the creature was somewhat of a weirdo with its bird-like head and roughly 100 super-sharp teeth, researchers concluded this was likely the smallest dinosaur ever found. (It likely weighed just 0.07 ounces (2 grams), the weight of two dollar bills, Live Science previously reported.)Whether the animal (Oculudentavis khaungraae) was a bird-like dinosaur or a lizard, that doesn’t negate the finding\\'s importance, the study’s scientists say. \"It\\'s just a really weird animal and an important discovery regardless of whether it\\'s a weird bird or a weird lizard with a bird head,\" study co-lead researcher Jingmai O\\'Connor, a senior professor of vertebrate paleontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Live Science in an email.Related: Photos: Hatchling preserved in amberOne study posted on bioRxiv, a preprint database where studies are “published\" before they undergo review by science peers, posits that the specimen is a lizard. In this new study, Zhiheng Li, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and colleagues looked back through the computed tomography (CT) scans of the little animal. They found several features of the animal that contradicted the idea of a bird-like dinosaur and said that it aligned much better with lizard traits. These included features of the animal’s lizard-like teeth and the features on its fenestra, or the openings in the skull behind the eye sockets that are found in animals such as dinosaurs and lizards.O\\'Connor and her colleagues posted their response, also on bioRxiv, saying that while they \"welcome any new interpretation or alternative hypothesis,\" of the creature, this new research \"failed to provide conclusive evidence for the reidentification.\" However, O\\'Connor did tell Live Science that \"I do think we were wrong and that Oculudentavis is a lizard, not a bird — you just can\\'t prove it unequivocally with the available evidence.\"So, the jury is still out on the creature’s true identity. Another team of researchers (different from the bioRxiv group) is studying a different specimen of the same species, but they have yet to publish their findings. If the creature is, in fact, a lizard, the fossil could represent a \"new and strange instance of convergent evolution between widely disparate reptile groups,\" O\\'Connor said. (Convergent evolution occurs when two organisms that are not closely related evolve similar traits. In this case, the creature had a bird-like head.)— Photos: Dinosaur-era bird sported ribbon-like feathers— Chuckwalla photos: Meet this large, desert-dwelling lizard— In photos: Flashy collared lizards of the North American desertsO\\'Connor noted that she had tested whether the specimen was a bird or a lizard in a phylogenetic, or family tree, analysis, that included several fossil birds. \"As long as any other birds were included in the analysis, Oculudentavis was resolved as a bird,\" O\\'Connor said. \"Removal of all birds made it resolve as a lizard but also caused major reptile clades to collapse, showing just how weird the specimen is.\"In addition, O\\'Connor said that Burmese amber is known to preserve hummingbird-size birds that lived during the Cretaceous period (145 million to 65 million years ago) in what is now Myanmar. However, it\\'s possible this creature wasn\\'t among them, she said.The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) published a letter in April (a month after the original Nature study came out) asking that its members refrain from using Burmese amber collected in or exported from Myanmar since June 2017, because profits earned from selling this amber might fuel the country\\'s decades-long civil war, according to a 2019 piece published in Science magazine. However, the piece that O\\'Connor and her colleagues examined was found in 2016.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'The ancestors of octopuses and squid once sported hard shells,but when did they lose their \"mobile homes\" and become agile, soft-bodied swimmers? A new study finds that this change may have occurred during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.Squishy creatures like squid and octopuses rarely leave behind well-preserved fossils. That has left scientists perplexed over when in the creatures\\' evolutionary history these cephalopods lost their shells. Researchers have now used a mix of fossil and genetic models to solve the puzzle.The ancestors of some modern cephalopods began to lose their shells during the so-called Mesozoic Marine Revolution. In this period, marine reptiles, certain fishes and other predators began to appear in the oceans, prompting prey to evolve to be more heavily armored or have other avoidance strategies to survive, the researchers said. Some cephalopods, like belemnites, sported internal shells, or skeletons, for instance, the scientists said. [Release the Kraken! Giant Squid Photos]During the revolution, \"we see the demise of a number of squid and octopus ancestors with more heavy internal shells,\" said study senior researcher Jakob Vinther, a paleobiologist at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom. \"They get replaced by these much more squishy forms that we have today, [from] around 160 [million] to 100 million years ago.\"The reason? The loss of shells made the ancient relatives of the modern-day octopus, squid and cuttlefish nimbler, a feature that likely helped these animals catch prey and evade predators, Vinther said.Cephalopods move by compressing their bodies and jetting water out of a funnel. \"Reducing the shell to this great extent gave them an even bigger advantage than their ancient counterparts with larger shells inside [had],\" Vinther said. \"These old fellows would have struggled to jet themselves away in the same ease.\"The heavy shells led to the demise of many cephalopod ancestors, because they couldn\\'t \"keep up with the \\'new [shell-less] kids on the block,\\'\" Vinther told Live Science.The researchers made the discovery using a molecular clock technique, which helped them determine when different cephalopod branches sprouted on the family tree.\"The key element of molecular clocks, though, is the fact that mutations steadily accumulate in genetic material over time,\" study co-researcher Davide Pisani, a professor of phylogenomics at the University of Bristol, said in the statement. \"So, by figuring out how many mutations per million years you find, and how it may vary between different groups, we can estimate evolutionary time.\"Then, the researchers compared the molecular clock data with the fossil record.\"What we see is that while there is some uncertainty in molecular clock estimates, octopuses and squid appear during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution,\" study lead researcher Alastair Tanner, a molecular biologist and bioinformatician at the University of Bristol, said in the statement. \"The two lines of evidence [fossil and genetic] come together to tell the tale of evolution.\"The study was published online today (March 1) in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.'}},\n",

On June 9, game warden Ryan Walker responded to a call reporting a deer that had been killed by a vehicle on a state highway — with a young fawn seen nearby.The mama deer had recently given birth, and when Walker arrived at the scene, both the doe and the fawn were already dead. But Walker spotted movement inside the mother — she had been carrying twins, and one was still inside her body. [Photos: See the World\\'s Cutest Baby Wild Animals]With no time to lose, Walker immediately performed a cesarean section at the side of the highway to deliver the fawn, and it was breathing on its own \"within seconds,\" according to the Facebook post.After the emergency C-section, the fawn was brought to a wildlife rehabilitator — a person licensed by the state of Oklahoma to care for wild animals that are injured or too young to survive on their own, according to the ODWC.Rescued newborn fawns are bottle-fed formula and sheltered in outdoor enclosures, and wildlife wardens occasionally check on their health and progress, Judy Weaver, a wildlife rehabilitator in Osage County, Oklahoma, who specializes in fawns, told Live Science.Game wardens deliberately keep the fences on these enclosures low. That way, a grown animal can easily jump over them when it\\'s ready to return to the wild, Weaver explained.\"The first fawn I raised — about eight years ago — was here until she was about 1 year old. Then she just jumped the fence and left,\" Weaver said.Thanks to Walker\\'s efforts, the future looks bright for the rescued fawn. However, not every fawn found alone is orphaned. Often, deer mothers leave their babies to forage for food. In fact, these moms may be close by even if you don\\'t see them, hiding until a perceived threat has moved on, according to the ODWC.\"As difficult as it can be, sometimes the best help we can offer young wildlife is to leave them alone and let nature run its course,\" Melynda Hickman, a biologist with the ODWC, said in a statement.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'Scientists have identified the babies of one of the world\\'s biggest fishes — the mola, or sunfish — and the youngster is so small that you could easily fit a dozen of them on your fingertip.Adult sunfish are the heaviest bony fish in the world, measuring up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weighing more than 4,400 lbs. (2,000 kilograms). They are also bizarrely shaped; adults resemble enormous, flattened pancakes topped by a massive dorsal fin like a shark\\'s. Their bodies are unusually short and have no tail fin, as most fish do. Instead, sunfish have a long structure at their rear end known as a clavus, which extends downward and resembles a boat\\'s rudder.But mola babies are a different story. As larvae, they measure just a few millimeters in length and their bodies look nothing like those of adults. Because of that, scientists struggle to match larvae with the correct species of mola. But for the first time, DNA sequencing identified the larvae of the bump-head sunfish (Mola alexandrini), representatives of the Australian Museum said in a statement.Related: In photos: The world\\'s largest bony fishThere are six sunfish species in the family Molidae; they are found in oceans throughout the world and have many whimsical names reflecting their peculiar shape. Sunfish are also known as \"poisson lune\" (French for \"moon fish\"); \"klumpfisk\" (Danish for \"lumpfish\"); and \"schwimmender kopf\" (German for \"swimming head\"), according to FishBase, a global online database of fish species.Because sunfish larvae are so tiny, they are extremely difficult to find, let alone identify. But in 2017, researchers working off the coast of New South Wales in southeastern Australia managed to collect tiny sunfish larva measuring about 0.2 inches (5 mm) long. By carefully removing one of a larva\\'s eyeballs for genetic sequencing, the scientists were able to minimize damage to the precious specimen and extract usable DNA, according to the statement. They compared the DNA to genetic samples collected from adult sunfish, and found a match to M. alexandrini.Having identified this wee baby — a youngster that is about 600 times smaller than a full-grown sunfish — scientists can now compare the larva to unidentifiedMolalarvae in the collections of the Australian Museum and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Hobart, Australia to see if there are more matches, said Marianne Nyegaard, a research associate at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, and one of the scientists who analyzed the tiny fish.– What the heck?! Images of evolution\\'s extreme oddities– Photos: The freakiest-looking fish– Amazing arapaima: Photos of the Amazon\\'s biggest fishIn addition to the bump-head sunfish, four more species of sunfish live in waters around Australia: the oceanic sunfish (Mola mola), the hoodwinker sunfish (Mola tecta), the point-tailed sunfish (Masturus lanceolatus) and the slender sunfish (Ranzania laevis). Further research into sunfishes\\' bug-size babies will help scientists piece together clues about early life for this group of unusual fish, Nyegaard said in the statement.\"If we want to protect these marine giants we need to understand their whole life history, and that includes knowing what the larvae look like and where they occur,\"Nyegaard said.'}},\n",

       "     'content': 'On Sept. 26, hobbyist nature photographer Oban van Shie was strolling through Bradgate park — an 800-year-old deer park in Leicestershire, England — when he was captivated by a strange sight. Sitting among the park\\'s resident herds of red and fallow deer, a snow-white buck rested its body in the tall, green grass.\"I had never seen a white deer before,\" van Shie told Live Science in an email. \"I was intrigued given their rarity, although many others that have visited the park will have no doubt seen it.\"Van Shie readied his camera and started snapping the buck from afar. It wasn\\'t until he got home that he realized the true treasure he\\'d recovered. The glorious deer — eyes clenched, mouth cracked, tongue lolling — had been photographed mid-sneeze.The next day, van Shie posted the buck pic on Reddit\\'s \"mildly interesting\" forum, where it received nearly 90,000 upvotes. While most commenters were impressed or eager to draw comparisons to the TV show \"BoJack Horseman,\" some questioned van Shie\\'s interpretation of the photo.\"I have received some comments doubting whether the deer was sneezing but I was far away enough from the deer that it wouldn’t feel threatened, especially considering that the park is open to the public and there wasn’t enough noise for it to have been calling out,\" van Shie said. \"Having done some research I am confident that it was in fact a sneeze.\"So, how rare is this photo, really? It\\'s hard to say for sure, but Live Science is going to bet its doe on \"pretty bucking rare.\" (Sorry… they say puns are a workout for your brain.)For starters, all-white deer — or \"leucistic\" deer — are the rarest of the four color-varieties of fallow deer.Unlike albinism, a condition that results from the absence of the pigment melanin, leucism is a recessive-gene condition that results from the loss of multiple types of pigment. While we can\\'t say exactly how common the condition is in fallow deer, nature.org previously reported that leucism effects about 1 percent of white-tail deer worldwide.And as for the sneezing? Not much research has been done on deer-sneeze frequency… or even human-sneeze frequency, for that matter. However, one small, snotty 2006 study found that a control group of nonallergic people sneezed an average of 1.1 times per person per day.If we hypothesize that the average sneeze takes about 1 second from start to finish, and that fallow deer sneeze exactly as often as the human-control group in that 2006 study, then the odds van Shie photographed a single deer at the precise moment of its daily sneeze are about 1 in 80,000. If there is a 1 percent chance that that sneezing deer is a leucistic deer, the odds of taking this photograph drop to about 1 in 8,000,000. (Live Science does not endorse doing math or science in this way.)In conclusion, van Shie\\'s photo is probably a lot rarer than seeing a humpback whale sneeze a rainbow, but less rare than meeting an astronaut who just sneezed all over his or her space helmet. Regardless — congratulations to Oban for taking a remarkable photograph that, for one glorious moment, made the internet sigh a collective \"aww… choo!\"'}},\n",
