### How to run  
1. Install all of the python modules using in the project (I provided elasticsearch modules folder within Elasticsearch_Jupyter_Notebook folder)
2. Open main.ipynb in Elasticsearch_Jupyter_Notebook folder
3. Run all cells (This might take about 1 hour and 15 minute in the web scraping part because the program will access all 944 links at runtime.)
4. Open Command line and cd to folder searchsite
5. Inside searchsite folder, type "python manage.py runserver"
6. Open the internet browser and enter localhost:8000
